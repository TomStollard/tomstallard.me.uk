Hey There! I'm Tom, a 18 year old guy who's a bit obsessed with technology. I'm currently a Computer Science Undergraduate at the University of Southampton.

I am primarily interested in networking and security, and maintain a small set of personal linux servers which I use for learning about networking, and testing new systems. I also have experience in front-end web development, as well as back-end development in Node.JS.
